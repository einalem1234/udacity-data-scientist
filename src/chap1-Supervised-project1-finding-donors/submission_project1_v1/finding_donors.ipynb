    "## Getting Started\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, you will employ several supervised algorithms of your choice to accurately model individuals' income using data collected from the 1994 U.S. Census. You will then choose the best candidate algorithm from preliminary (vorläufig) results and further optimize this algorithm to best model the data. Your goal with this implementation is to construct a model that accurately predicts whether an individual makes more than $50,000. This sort of task can arise in a non-profit setting, where organizations survive on donations.  Understanding an individual's income can help a non-profit better understand how large of a donation to request, or whether or not they should reach out to begin with.  While it can be difficult to determine an individual's general income bracket directly from public sources, we can (as we will see) infer this value from other publically available features. \n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). The datset was donated by Ron Kohavi and Barry Becker, after being published in the article _\"Scaling Up the Accuracy of Naive-Bayes Classifiers: A Decision-Tree Hybrid\"_. You can find the article by Ron Kohavi [online](https://www.aaai.org/Papers/KDD/1996/KDD96-033.pdf). The data we investigate here consists of small changes to the original dataset, such as removing the `'fnlwgt'` feature and records with missing or ill-formatted entries."

    "For highly-skewed feature distributions such as `'capital-gain'` and `'capital-loss'`, it is common practice to apply a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_transformation_(statistics)\">logarithmic transformation</a> on the data so that the very large and very small values do not negatively affect the performance of a learning algorithm. Using a logarithmic transformation significantly reduces the range of values caused by outliers. Care must be taken when applying this transformation however: The logarithm of `0` is undefined, so we must translate the values by a small amount above `0` to apply the the logarithm successfully.\n",

Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'capital-gain'` or `'capital-loss'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "From the table in **Exploring the Data** above, we can see there are several features for each record that are non-numeric. Typically, learning algorithms expect input to be numeric, which requires that non-numeric features (called *categorical variables*) be converted. One popular way to convert categorical variables is by using the **one-hot encoding** scheme. One-hot encoding creates a _\"dummy\"_ variable for each possible category of each non-numeric feature. For example, assume `someFeature` has three possible entries: `A`, `B`, or `C`. We then encode this feature into `someFeature_A`, `someFeature_B` and `someFeature_C`.\n",

    "| 2 |  A  |  | 1 | 0 | 0 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, as with the non-numeric features, we need to convert the non-numeric target label, `'income'` to numerical values for the learning algorithm to work. Since there are only two possible categories for this label (\"<=50K\" and \">50K\"), we can avoid using one-hot encoding and simply encode these two categories as `0` and `1`, respectively. In code cell below, you will need to implement the following:\n",
    " - Use [`pandas.get_dummies()`](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/generated/pandas.get_dummies.html?highlight=get_dummies#pandas.get_dummies) to perform one-hot encoding on the `'features_log_minmax_transform'` data.\n",

    "### Metrics and the Naive Predictor\n",
    "*CharityML*, equipped with their research, knows individuals that make more than \\$50,000 are most likely to donate to their charity. Because of this, *CharityML* is particularly interested in predicting who makes more than \\$50,000 accurately. It would seem that using **accuracy** as a metric for evaluating a particular model's performace would be appropriate. Additionally, identifying someone that *does not* make more than \\$50,000 as someone who does would be detrimental(schädlich) to *CharityML*, since they are looking to find individuals willing to donate. Therefore, a model's ability to precisely predict those that make more than \\$50,000 is *more important* than the model's ability to **recall**(abfragen, abrufen, kündigen) those individuals. We can use **F-beta score** as a metric that considers both precision and recall:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ F_{\\beta} = (1 + \\beta^2) \\cdot \\frac{precision \\cdot recall}{\\left( \\beta^2 \\cdot precision \\right) + recall} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "In particular, when $\\beta = 0.5$, more emphasis is placed on precision. This is called the **F$_{0.5}$ score** (or F-score for simplicity).\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the distribution of classes (those who make at most \\$50,000, and those who make more), it's clear most individuals do not make more than \\$50,000. This can greatly affect **accuracy**, since we could simply say *\"this person does not make more than \\$50,000\"* and generally be right, without ever looking at the data! Making such a statement would be called **naive**, since we have not considered any information to substantiate the claim. It is always important to consider the *naive prediction* for your data, to help establish a benchmark for whether a model is performing well. That been said, using that prediction would be pointless: If we predicted all people made less than \\$50,000, *CharityML* would identify no one as donors. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note: Recap of accuracy, precision, recall\n",
    "\n",
    "**Accuracy** measures how often the classifier makes the correct prediction. It’s the ratio of the number of correct predictions to the total number of predictions (the number of test data points).\n",
    "$$\\frac{True Positives + True Negatives}{\\text{nb of all test data points}} = \\frac{TP+TN}{TP+TN+FP+FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Precision** tells us what proportion of messages we classified as spam, actually were spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all positives(all words classified as spam, irrespective of whether that was the correct classificatio), in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "$$\\frac{True Positives}{(True Positives + False Positives)} = \\frac{TP}{TP + FP}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recall(sensitivity)** tells us what proportion of messages that actually were spam were classified by us as spam.\n",
    "It is a ratio of true positives(words classified as spam, and which are actually spam) to all the words that were actually spam, in other words it is the ratio of\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\frac{True Positives}{(True Positives + False Negatives)} = \\frac{TP}{TP+FN}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "For classification problems that are skewed in their classification distributions like in our case, for example if we had a 100 text messages and only 2 were spam and the rest 98 weren't, accuracy by itself is not a very good metric. We could classify 90 messages as not spam(including the 2 that were spam but we classify them as not spam, hence they would be false negatives) and 10 as spam(all 10 false positives) and still get a reasonably good accuracy score. For such cases, precision and recall come in very handy. These two metrics can be combined to get the F1 score, which is weighted average(harmonic mean) of the precision and recall scores. This score can range from 0 to 1, with 1 being the best possible F1 score(we take the harmonic mean as we are dealing with ratios)."

Therefore our Accuracy in this case becomes the same as our Precision(True Positives/(True Positives + False Positives)) as every prediction that we have made with value '1' that should have '0' becomes a False Positive; therefore our denominator in this case is the total number of records we have in total. \n",

    "\n",
    "- based on the Bayes theorem\n",
    "- a Naive Bayes classifier assumes that the presence of a particular feature in a class is unrelated to the presence of any other feature.\n",
    "- When dealing with continuous data, a typical assumption is that the continuous values associated with each class are distributed according to a Gaussian distribution. \n",
    "- Naive Bayes algorithms are mostly used in sentiment analysis, spam filtering, recommendation systems etc. They are fast and easy to implement but their biggest disadvantage is that the requirement of predictors to be independent. [Reference](https://towardsdatascience.com/naive-bayes-classifier-81d512f50a7c)\n",
    "- NB has high bais and low variance. Hence it makes its application limited\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- Classify mails as *spam* or *not-spam*\n",
    "- Classify a newspaper article to a topic (based on word occurances in the text)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Decision Trees***\n",
    "\n",
    "- When we fit a decision tree to a training dataset, the top few nodes on which the tree is split are essentially the most important variables within the dataset and feature selection is completed automatically!\n",
    "- Decision trees require relatively little effort from users for data preparation\n",
    "- Nonlinear relationships between parameters do not affect tree performance\n",
    "\n",
    "Use Cases: \n",
    "- In finance, forecasting future outcomes and assigning probabilities to those outcomes\n",
    "- Customer’s willingness to purchase a given product in a given setting, i.e. offline and online both\n",
    "\n",
    "***Ensemble Methods (Bagging, AdaBoost, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)***\n",
    "\n",
    "- the first step of Ensemble Methods is to create multiple classification/regression models using some training dataset. Each base model can be created using different splits of the same training dataset and same algorithm, or using the same dataset with different algorithms, or any other method.

    "\n",
    "***K-Nearest Neighbors (KNeighbors)***\n",

    "\n",
    "Use Cases:\n",
    "- Recommondation System (propose similar products)\n",
    "- semantically similar documents (i.e., documents containing similar topics)\n",
    "\n",
    "***Stochastic Gradient Descent Classifier (SGDC)***\n",
    "\n",
    "- SGD has been successfully applied to large-scale and **sparse** machine learning problems often encountered in text classification and natural language processing. Given that the data is sparse, the classifiers in this module easily scale to problems with more than 10^5 training examples and more than 10^5 features.

    "### Answer - Question 2\n",
    "#### Model 1 - Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBT)\n",
    "Boosting classifiers use weak learners which performe slightly better than a random choice. These weak learners are then combined to get better.\n",
    "\n",
    "One real-world example for a gradient boosting classifier (GBT) is the search engine of Yahoo. The search engine uses it to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant URLs [ref](http://www.kdd.org/kdd2016/papers/files/adf0361-yinA.pdf). Another example are anomaly detection in unbalanced data sets as DNA sequences [ref](https://medium.com/@aravanshad/gradient-boosting-versus-random-forest-cfa3fa8f0d80).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength of the model:\n",
    "One of the strength of the gradient boosting classifier is its simpleness. No mathematical notation is needed for the understanding. GBTs build consecutively trees to split the data. Each subsequent tree can correct errors made by previously trained trees [ref](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-Gradient-Boosting-over-Random-Forests).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "GBTs build the trees sequentially, so the training takes some time. Gradient boosting needs a lot of training data as it is prone to overfitting [ref](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-Gradient-Boosting-over-Random-Forests).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Good kandidate for the problem:\n",
    "Even when GBT needs time to train, it performs good. The GBT is able to learn correlation between different features, which is useful for this data set [ref](https://medium.com/data-design/ensembles-of-tree-based-models-why-correlated-features-do-not-trip-them-and-why-na-matters-7658f4752e1b). As GBT Methods only have three parameters, it is not too complex in understanding [ref](https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-advantages-disadvantages-of-using-Gradient-Boosting-over-Random-Forests).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 2 - Decision Trees\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world application:\n",
    "If a decision tree was trained, it can be used as an answer wisard too find helpful information for users, like shown by ATS Trust [ref](https://www.funderstanding.com/blog/real-life-application-decision-trees/). Another use case is the diagnosis of illnesses. Here the tree uses pattern of syntoms to differentiate different therapies or clinical subtypes [ref](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4466856/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength of the model:\n",
    "Decision trees are easy to understand and interpret. To use decision trees, no assumptions about the linearity of the data has to be made [ref](http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics). Another strength of the model is, that it can handle non-perfect data, like missing values or outliers [ref](http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "The weakness of this model is when one constraint is described by several variables, theses variables are not examined collectivly. The trees assume that all variables have dependencies to each other. This is an assumption for this data set [ref](https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/1292/what-is-the-weak-side-of-decision-trees).\n",
    "Another weakness of decision trees is the notion for overfitting when the tree growth is not limited [ref](http://www.simafore.com/blog/bid/62333/4-key-advantages-of-using-decision-trees-for-predictive-analytics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Good kandidate for the problem:\n",
    "The decision tree approach was chosen, because it was mentioned in the paper which provided the data set. The researcher used the decision tree approach to segment the data, and that is a similar use case like for this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Model 3 - Linear SVM\n",
    "Real-world application:\n",
    "A real-world application is the classification of documents into categories. The number of categories is predefined. The text, for eample a news paper article, is analysed and categorised. [ref](https://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0612817.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "Strength of the model:\n",
    "The plane to divide the data has the same dimensionality as the data. The basic algorithm finds a possible split of the data. Each SVM has a kernel, with an appropriate kernel function any problem can be solved [ref](https://statinfer.com/204-6-8-svm-advantages-disadvantages-applications/).\n",
    "\n",
    "Weaknesses of the model:\n",
    "The kernel is one of the advantages and disadvantages of SVMs. You have to chose a particular kernel for each problem to find a good solution. This means SVMs do not make any assumptions about the structure in the data [ref](https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/3zqwbc/where_do_support_vector_machines_perform_badly/). \n",
    "\n",
    "Good kandidate for the problem:\n",
    "SVMs search for a way to seperate the data on a hyperplane. The target is to divide the categories so that there is a clear gap between them [ref](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine). The assumption to chose this algorithm is, that people who earn more than $50.000 are easily seperatable from people who earn less."

    "A Support Vector Machine uses a geometrical formula to differentiate between the two classes. All persons are described by lots of different variables.\n",

    "Assume, there would only be two basic variables, the body height and the income of the person. Let's simulate, that there is a correlation between these two values: Little persons earn a lot of money whereas tall persons earn less money. If you would plot this data, there would be a gap between the two groups. And there would be a height to distiguish if a person earns more or less than `$`50.000. The SVM algrotihm would then search for this threshold value. It would start with a random value and measure how good the split is. Depending on which side are too many values/persons misclassified, the threshold is adapted. This adaptation continues until the seperation between the classes is satisfying.

With less features required to train, the expectation is that training and prediction time is much lower — at the cost of performance metrics. From the visualization above, we see that the top five most important features contribute more than half of the importance of **all** features present in the data. This hints that we can attempt to *reduce the feature space* and simplify the information required for the model to learn. The code cell below will use the same optimized model you found earlier, and train it on the same training set *with only the top five important features*. "
